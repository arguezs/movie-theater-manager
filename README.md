# Movie World

*Other languages: [ES](README.es.md)*

## Project Description

Movie World is a web application focused on the management of a movie theater. It is being developed as final project for the Web Application Development course.

This application will allow the user to browse the movie listing select any movie they want to watch and make a purchase of the seats for the specified session and date.

It will also allow admin members to alter movie listings and sessions, and visualize statistics on present and previous movie listings and sessions.

**This is currently a work in progress.**

## Technologies

The main purpose behind this project is to familiarize myself with the use of different frameworks and libraries.

The client side of the application will be developed using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), with the help of [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) to design the UI.

The server side will be developed with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).

Connections between the client side and the server side are being handled with [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

For the database, I will be using the ORM [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) and working with MySQL.
